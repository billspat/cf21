As a part of this program, fellows will participate in a series of workshops during the fall semester to: Determine the aspects of your research that can be accomplished with cloud computing; Incorporate cloud-based systems into your research application or workflow; and Understand the strengths and limitations of commercial cloud computing with the goal of improving research yield and minimizing cost, and develop a workflow that utilizes that knowledge. Background MSU doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers are invited to apply in the summer and approximately 18 are select each year. The program started in 2021. If you find this website, please check back in the Summer of 2022 for announcements for invitation to participate for MSU grads and postdocs.
