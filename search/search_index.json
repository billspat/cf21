Cloud storage is quite different from what most are used to related to saving a file to your disk or USB removable media or even our HPC. During our workshop on creating a VM we didn't use cloud storage, we simply create a VM \"virtual disk\" that is attached to the VM just like your hard drive is attached to your own computer. However there are disadvantats to this : 1. the main OS disk is typically deleted when the VM is deleted, although yuo can create a 'durable' disk to share 1. the data on the main OS disk is tied to that Virtual Machine and hence that operating system, that is, it's typically unacceesbile from other cloud services 1. it is limited in size. The largest of virtual disks are around 1 TB. Azure Cloud storage accounts are limited to 5 TB and you may have multiple storage accounts. 1. You can only move data to/from a virtual or shared disk storage using a virtual machine 1. Most importantly virtual disks very expensive compared to cloud storage Cloud companies think of \"storage\" as anything that save files, or perhaps more importantly anything they can market to you as something to save files.
