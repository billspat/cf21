# How Does the Cloud Work?

## Introduction

When many people think of "cloud computing" they think of computers in the cloud, or virtual machines.   Cloud computing companies offer much more than just virtualized hardware, but this is a good place to start.   This session is designed to be a hands-on workshop where we walk-through creating the resources needed for to run a computer in the cloud, logging into this computer, copying data and using that data in a program.    At the end of the session you should have a good introduction of what it means to "cloud compute."
