# What is the cloud and how does it work?

![Chaplin still from Modern Times 1936](../img/chaplin_clockworks.jpg){ align=right} When many people think of "cloud computing" they think of computers in the cloud, or virtual machines.   Cloud computing companies offer much more than just virtualized hardware, but this is a good place to start.   This session is designed to be a hands-on workshop where we walk-through creating the resources needed for to run a computer in the cloud, logging into this computer, copying data and using that data in a program.    At the end of the session you should have a good introduction of what it means to "cloud compute."
