## Introduction

Data servers like Relational Databases can be a powerful tool for even small research projects.   By Data Servers or Systems 
we mean any server with data processing capabilities that you connect to with a client to send data, commands and receive results.  The most widely used and classic example is the relational database management system (RDBMs) invented in the 1970s but there are many other types.  A central advantage of data servers is ability to have multiple econnections at once from many users, a busy web application, or parallel processing.    Like Big Data tools, these data systems don't require cloud computing, but cloud companies offer database servers with a few clicks that require very littls management.  A data server could be a productive addition to your cloud architecturee, or the central aspect of your fellowship project.
