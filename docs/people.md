![Pat Bills](img/people/patbills_photo.jpg){ align=right}  My research background is in data systems for ecology (MS Entomology, MSU).  I have experience in database design, R, Python and web application programming.  I've worked in research IT for over 25 yrs for departments and labs across MSU, including for MSU ICER as a research consultant and trainer.   I'm currently the technical lead for the data science team in the Analytics and Data Solutions or A.D.S , part of MSU's central IT services.  
Like many I've built and worked with on-campus linux systems for many years including the MSU HPC.  I started my cloud journey in 2017 during a workshop at the HPC conference where I saw [Ian Foster](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VGoSakQAAAAJ&hl=en) (our textbook author) present his vision of research on the cloud.    Since then I've used cloud services from Google, Amazon and Azure, currently focusing on Microsoft Azure.  At MSU ADS we use cloud services where appropriate for our data systems or applications, and I'll use examples directly from our work in this class.
