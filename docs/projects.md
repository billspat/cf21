# About The Fellowship Projects

The fellowship is structured to first provide materials and help to learn core cloud concepts and activies, and to promote how to learn about cloud from existing documentation.  This is to support a small, cloud-based research project that is the main object of the fellowship

Qs and Notes about projects

Q. Do I have to use my own data for my project or can I use data from the web or other public data?

A. you can bring any data that you may use for your research, or that demonstrates cloud processes you may use in your research

Q. I don't know how to use the stuff I'm learning so far for my project.  what do I do?

A. We will cover several new topics that are adjancent to cloud computing that may be suited for you.  Some of these do not require yo 

 - Databases for tabular or structured data
 - Data systems in general
 - Big data processing with Python notebooks

Q. Are there constraints on the things I want do with my project?  

A.  Our goal is to facilitate your education and advancing your research program.   If you use the fellowship to develop only a small system to show what's possible or not possible, even on public data, that uses cloud computing, that is an acceptable project. 

Q.  Do I have to use programming in my project?

A.  Most of the examples provided in the fellowship talk about processing data with scripts such as R or Python and many researchers are using these for data analysis, but it's not required for a successful project.   You could install a program on a powerful virtual machine and show how to use that software along with cloud storage to tackle a large data set (for example).   Secondly there are many forms of cloud computing that are not traditional such as data systems which may use a GUI or a language like SQL. 

One important aspect of a successful project is "workflow thinking" or how could you design your process so that you could do it 100 times or with some form of automation.   That often requires programming but there are cloud systems that don't require programming (e.g. Azure Data Factory) but you may want learn about data base systems.    Accumulating and organizing data is a huge part of successful research and there are cloud tools to help with that. 

Q.  I have structured data and I want to process it and using a VM or storage don't seem quite right.  

You may want to investigate using a database.   We don't have time to cover how to use to a database in this fellowship but can point you to starter documentation.   

Q. I want to make a web site or application for my project, can I use a VM?  how do I do that?

A.  While the cloud was invented in part to run web applications, Web application design is a huge subject and the programming involved is almost as complex as any programming or data work you've done for your research.  
We will cover somethigns about using Azure services for hosting websites but don't attempt this for your project unless you have previous experience making websites or web applications, or if you are up for the big challenge of learning webdev along with cloud computing.
