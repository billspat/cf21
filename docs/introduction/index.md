# Introduction to the 2021-22 MSU Cloud Fellowship

**Welcome to the 2021-22 Cloud Fellowship!**

As stated in applicatation letter, this Fall semester you will participate in a series of asynchronous activities and hands-on workshops that will teach you how to:
 
  * Determine the aspects of your research that can be accomplished with cloud computing;
  * Incorporate cloud-based systems into your research application or workflow; and
  * Understand the strengths and limitations of commercial cloud computing with the goal of improving research yield and minimizing cost, and develop a workflow that utilizes that knowledge.

This Fall semester we have a series of sessions, each with pre-session (asynchronous) activities, a synchromous meeting up to 2 hrs (in-person vs remote TBD), and follow up activities for those who want more.   Our first synchronous session is Friday September 3rd

## Pre-session activity:

Please complete the following activities prior to our first synchronmous meeting September 3 to ensure you have access to the ways we will communicate. 

 - Teams: 
   You should have all been given access to a Team "TEAM NAME TBD" via your NetID.  See documentaiton on how to log-in to https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/
    * exercise: please log-in to Teams and post  message in the main channel just saying "hello" with your name and department and you prefer to be addressed


 - ensure access to Azure Portal
   * go to https://portal.azure.com
   * log-in with your MSU netid and password
   * click on the 'subscriptions' button and confirm the MSU cloud fellowship  is there
   * on the main page (Azure calls this the 'dashboard') ensure you see a "resource group" called TBD
   * you don't need to (and shouldn't) create any new resources, simply confirm you can see the resources

- view instructor introduction videos
    - Brian O'shea, program lead, introduction to program
    - [Pat Bills](#), lead instructor  <!-- TODO create introduction video and post to media space -->
    - Danielle Barnes
    - Mahmoud Parvizi

- Introduce yourself! 
  We use  Google drive for writing documents.   
  * log-in to drive.google.com and look in the "Shared Drives" you should see "CloudFellows21"
  * in the Shared drive, confirm you see a sub-folder called "for_participants"
  * please create a new document, titled with your name inside the folder there "participant bios"
    - include your name, department, breif summary of your work  
 
- Reading : 
  * [Chapter 1: Orienting in the cloud universe](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html) from **"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering"**
  * [Using Cloud Computing for Academic Research](#), Mahmoud Parvizi <!-- todo add PDF and link -->
