## Welcome! 

The goals of this session are to orient you to this program, set-up our technology, introduce ourselves, provide some background on cloud computing, and discuss what all of our expectations are.    For this session, like the others, we have some pre-session activities for the week, followed by a meeting Friday 2-3:30pm.  

## Readings  

  * [Chapter 1: Orienting in the cloud universe](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html) <br>from **"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Foster and Gannon**  
     ( *[Alternative link to publisher preview chapter](https://mitpress.ublish.com/ereader/239/?preview#page/1)*  )
  * [Using Cloud Computing for Academic Research](../references/DRAFT_cloud_computing_for_academic_research_parvizi_2021.pdf), Mahmoud Parvizi (draft version)

## Activities:

Please complete the following activities prior to our first synchronmous meeting September 3. 

**Start with Microsoft Teams**
 
   You should have all been given access to a Team "MSU ICER Cloud Fellowship" via your NetID.  See MSU's documentation on how to use MS Teams here:  [https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/](https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/)  ( the link on that page requires yet another MSU log-in)    

  * please log-in to Teams and post message in the main channel just saying "hello" with your name and department and how you prefer to be addressed.   

**Confirm Access to Azure Portal**

  * go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
  * log-in with your MSU netid and password
  * click on the 'subscriptions' button and confirm the MSU cloud fellowship is there
  * on the main page (Azure calls this the 'dashboard') ensure you see a "resource group" called TBD 
  <!-- TODO create resource group -->
  * you don't need to (and shouldn't) create any new resources or work with this website,  simply confirm you have access and can see the resources.  thank you!
  
**Introduce yourself!**  

We will use google drive for sharing documents and files

  * log-in to drive.google.com and look in the "Shared Drives" you should see "CloudFellows21"
  * in the Shared drive, confirm you see a sub-folder called "for_participants"
  * please create a new document, titled with your name inside the folder there "participant bios"
      - include your name, department, brief summary of your work
