## Welcome! 

The goals of this session are to orient you to this program, set up our technology, introduce ourselves, provide some background on cloud computing, and discuss what all of our expectations are.    For this session, like the others, we have some pre-session activities for the week, followed by a meeting Friday, September 3, from 2:00-3:30pm.  

## Readings  

  * [Chapter 1: Orienting in the cloud universe](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html) <br>from **"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Foster and Gannon**  
     ( *[Alternative link to publisher preview chapter](https://mitpress.ublish.com/ereader/239/?preview#page/1)*  )
  * [Using Cloud Computing for Academic Research](../references/DRAFT_cloud_computing_for_academic_research_parvizi_2021.pdf), Mahmoud Parvizi (draft version)

## Activities:

Please complete the following activities prior to our first synchronous meeting September 3. 

**Introduce yourself on Microsoft Teams**
 
   You should have all been given access to a Team "MSU ICER Cloud Fellowship" via your NetID.  See MSU's documentation on how to use MS Teams here:  [https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/](https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/)  ( the link on that page requires yet another MSU log-in).  

  * Please log in to Teams and post a message in the main channel just saying "hello" with your name, department and how you prefer to be addressed.   

**Confirm Access to Azure Portal**

  * Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
  * Log in with your MSU netid and password.
  * Click on the 'subscriptions' button and confirm the _MSU cloud fellowship_ subscription is there.
  * On the main page (Azure calls this the 'dashboard') ensure you see a "resource group" called _TBD_.
  * You don't need to (and shouldn't) create any new resources or work with this website; simply confirm you have access and can see the resources.  Thank you!
