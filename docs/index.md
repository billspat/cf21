## About

The MSU Cloud Fellowship is cross disciplinary program produced by MSUâ€™s Institute of Cyber-Enabled Research and the ITS Analytics and Data Solutions group for invited MSU doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers to join the first cohort of MSU Cloud Computing Fellows.  As a part of this program, fellows will participate in a series of workshops during the fall semester to:

  * Determine the aspects of your research that can be accomplished with cloud computing;
  * Incorporate cloud-based systems into your research application or workflow; and
  * Understand the strengths and limitations of commercial cloud computing with the goal of improving research yield and minimizing cost, and develop a workflow that utilizes that knowledge.
 

## Background

MSU doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers are invited to apply in the summer and approximately 18 are select each year.  The program started in 2019.   If you are an MSU graduate student or post-doc and interested in participating next year, please check back in the Summer of 2022 for announcements for invitation to participate, or request to join the [MSU ICER mailing list](https://icer.msu.edu/getting-latest-hpcc-updates)
