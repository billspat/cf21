# Session 4: Moving Data in Azure

There are many ways to move data around in the cloud.  They are based on the limitations of data movement across complex and distant networks and the scale of cloud networks and storage, and the needs of companies to move and process huge amounts of data on a schedule.   

## Reading

- Optional : From Chapter 3 [Using Cloud Storage Services](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/using_storage.html) in [Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering](https://cloud4scieng.org/)  
    - Introduction
    - Section 3.3 (Azure)

   This chapter is written for python programmers, and starts with Amazon Web Services (AWS) examples, then moves to Azure examples in comparison to AWS.   If you are not a programmer or haven't heard of AWS storage (known as 'S3'), then skim through to get an idea of how you may use these.
